# Simple-Chat-Bot

# 🤖 Chatbot using NLP and Deep Learning

This is a simple AI-powered chatbot built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a neural network. It can understand user inputs and respond appropriately based on predefined intents. The goal was to understand how chatbots work under the hood — from preprocessing text data to training a classification model and deploying the model in an interactive chat environment.
